## The Foundation of Great Photography

Composition is the backbone of compelling images. It's how you arrange elements within your frame to create visual harmony and tell a story.

### Why Composition Matters

A well-composed photograph guides the viewer's eye and creates emotional impact. It transforms ordinary scenes into extraordinary images.

## Essential Composition Techniques

### 1. Rule of Thirds

Divide your frame into nine equal parts using two horizontal and two vertical lines. Place key elements along these lines or at their intersections.

- Position horizons on the top or bottom line
- Place eyes at intersection points for portraits
- Align vertical subjects with the grid lines

### 2. Leading Lines

Use natural or man-made lines to guide the viewer's eye through your image:

- Roads, rivers, or fences in landscapes
- Architectural lines in urban photography
- Arms or legs in portrait photography

> "Composition is the strongest way of seeing." â€” Edward Weston

### 3. Framing

Use elements within your scene to create natural frames around your subject:

- Windows or doorways
- Tree branches
- Architectural elements

## Advanced Composition Concepts

### Negative Space

Empty space around your subject can create powerful minimalist compositions.

### Symmetry and Patterns

Perfect for architectural and abstract photography, creating visually satisfying images.

## Putting It All Together

While these rules provide guidance, remember they can be broken creatively. The best photographers know the rules so well they can bend them effectively.
